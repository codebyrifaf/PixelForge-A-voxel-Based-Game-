# PixelForge

**PixelForge** is a custom-built voxel-based sandbox game engine made with Unity 3D and C#. Inspired by games like Minecraft, PixelForge features dynamic terrain generation, block interaction, custom lighting, non-physics character controllers, and much more — all handcrafted from the ground up.
